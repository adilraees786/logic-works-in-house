                                <p>Logic Works uses specific metrics to track the success of each campaign. We

                                    specific social media platform. Click-through rates (CTR) are also included as
                                    elements in the analysis. These tell us to what extent the content is pushing
                                    traffic to your website. In terms of efficiency, conversion rates, including
                                    sign-ups or purchases, indicate how efficiently the campaign is working. We
                                    track ROI to be sure that resources are optimally consumed. Our team provides
                                    regular reports to keep you informed. Continuous monitoring allows us to adjust
