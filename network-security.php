              <div class="panel">
                <p> Network security protects your systems and data from attacks, unauthorized access, and misuse. It
                  keeps your business running smoothly by reducing risks and blocking harmful threats.</p>

              <div class="panel">
                <p> Vulnerability scans should be done every month or after any system updates. Regular scans help catch
                  issues early and reduce the chance of data loss.</p>

                  to your systems. Every business uses different types of network setups so our checks adjust to fit
                  what you use. Once the review is complete, we report any issues we find. This gives us a base to build
                  stronger protection that helps prevent real problems not just fix surface issues.</p>
